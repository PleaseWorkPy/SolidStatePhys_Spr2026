## Hey folks—I'm your grader

If you would like to know more about me, check out my landing page. Otherwise, right to business. 

I am working on taking notes on textbook, "The Oxford Solid State Basics" by Steven H. Simon. These notes will include:
- Core chapter notes (definitions, results, derivations, and key takeaways)
- Conceptual clarifications where the textbook moves quickly
- Supplemental references (other textbooks, lecture content, and selected online resources)

**Please do not use this as your primary method of learning.** The notes I take are meant to serve as a companion to your own reading and supplement the (awesome!) in-class lectures.

If you find an error, unclear explanation, or typo, feel free to open an issue or let me know. All files are WIP until May 2026.
